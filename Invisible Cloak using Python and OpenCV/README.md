# Invisible Cloak using Python and OpenCV
<p align="justify">Here, I created this magical experience using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation. In order to run this code, i used an mp4 video. I must have a cloth of the same color and no other color should be visible in that cloth. I took the red cloth. If I am taking some other cloth, the code will remain the same but with minute changes.

**Features:**<br>
a. Capture and store the background frame.<br>
b. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.<br>
c. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask.<br>
d. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect.<br>

**Requirements:**<br>
Python<br>
OpenCV

# Detecting Faces from Video using Python and OpenCV
<p align="justify">The process of detecting faces plays a major role in the process of automation and machine learning process. The face detection concept needs some process for preparing your system for the process. Here, I am using the Python programming language for detecting faces in images and videos. It requires the installation of additional packages such as OpenCV. OpenCV stands for Open Source Computer Vision.

Requirements:<br>
Python<br>
OpenCV<br>
Numpy<br>
Haarcascade Frontal face classifiers
